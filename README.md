# EmmaStevensVlogsTimer
Workout Timer built for my sister's Youtube platform

Goals for project:
1. Ability to choose between predefined timers or create own timer.
2. Timer consists of a number of sets containing a number of rounds which contain the exercises.
3. Timer can be started, paused and when it reaches 0, will move onto the next stage. Next stage is either a new round, rest period, next exercise, etc.
4. Ability to constuct own custom timer. 
  a. Can choose the exercises to show up in timer.
  b. Choose the length of timer, including length of rest periods, exercise periods, round periods, and circuit/set periods
  c. Be able to send custom timer over messaging apps to other people with the app so they can use the timer you have created
5. Have sound clips during workout e.g. "You are halfway there, keep it up!"
